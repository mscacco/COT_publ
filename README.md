Code supporting the manuscript "Airflows redefine the cost of aerial transport in the wild"

These R scripts support the analytical workflow and findings of the study "Airflows redefine the cost of aerial transport in the wild". 
The aim of this study was to update existing equations defining the cost of transport for flying animals, mainly developed using data extracted from wind tunnels under laboratory settings, with detailed information about flight behaviour in the wild obtained from biologging technology and radar. Estimating the proportion of time flying animals spent in flapping flight, allowed us to redefine how energetic costs vary with body mass and with airflows, and the selective benefits of different forms of aerial locomotion.

The summary dataset supporting the findings is deposited at the Edmond repository at this link .... This was produced using the workflow in scripts 0 to 7. With this dataset, the analysis and figures starting from script 8 can be easily reproduced. At the same repository as well as in the paper, you can find a table containing the list of single datasets used for this study as well as the ethical permits and contact information of the researchers to be contacted for data requests.
